A Docker file is made to build a Docker container which sets up an environment with the necessary dependencies for working with the Panda robot and the AM_robot project. The Docker file and Docker commands can be found here: https://github.com/theacharlotte/AM_robot_docker

The Docker file includes installation of libfranka v0.9.2 and frankx v0.2.0 for communication with Franka Emika Panda robot, and the dependencies for libfranka, frankx and AM_robot. Python 3.10 is installed as well as usefull packages such as git and GCC.

To use this container, ensure Docker is installed on your system and build the image by looking at the commands in the init.md file. Once built, you can run the container to get environment needed to run the functions in this (AM-robot) project.
